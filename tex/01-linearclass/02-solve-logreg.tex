Follow the instructions in \texttt{src/01-linearclass/logreg.py} to train a logistic regression classifier using Newton's Method. Starting with $\theta = \vec{0}$, run Newton's Method until the updates to $\theta$ are small: Specifically,  train until the first iteration $k$ such that $\vert\theta_{k} - \theta_{k-1}\vert_1 < \epsilon$, where $\epsilon = 1\times 10^{-5}$. Make sure to write your model's predicted probabilities on the validation set to the file specified in the code.

To verify a correct implementation, consider creating a plot of the \textbf{validation data} with $x_1$ on the horizontal axis and $x_2$ on the vertical axis. To visualize the two classes, use a different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$ with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with $y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary found by logistic regression (i.e, line corresponding to $p(y\vert x) = 0.5$).

Please run logistic regression on dataset 1. No plot submission is required. If you do create a plot, it should look similar to the following:
